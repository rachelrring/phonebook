# phonebook

I craeted this project to practice the use of dictionaries

This project is a simple phonebook app that allows a user:
  - input contacts (name and number)
  - print phone book (name and numbers)
  - print only contact names
  - search through phonebook for a name and returns the name=phoneNumber
